# Explainable Graph-theoretical Machine Learning
A Python repository for constructing metabolic distance graphs from FDG-PET scans and using graph edge weights as input features for prediction with a KernelSVR model. This approach predicts eight multivariate cognitive scores related to Alzheimerâ€™s disease and identifies the top ten most predictive edges for each score, improving model interpretability.
